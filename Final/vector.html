                Growing up, my parents often took us to the pet store. I loved looking at all the fish, frogs, dogs and especially the birds. Sweet memories of those times influenced my vector final project immensely.Â

                In this work, the parrot is the most time consuming part. While it was a bit of a challenge, it was most definitely worth it! This is a logo for a made up pet store, named after my younger brother.
