                    My name is Janice. I was born and raised in San Francisco. Currently in my first semester at CCSF, I am taking this course because I want to explore design and learn some digital skills. In high school, I took several art classes and also took 3D design. I thoroughly enjoyed those classes. Therefore, I decided to attend CCSF right after High School to explore design a little more, to test the waters and see if I want to go down the graphic design path. As of now, I am working on the AA degree in Graphic Design.

                    Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, at times, I feel a bit overwhelmed and helpless. There are also many things that I can no longer do without being afraid of getting near people, even the ones closest to me. Therefore, for all the pieces that I worked on in VMD 105, I attempted to convey the feeling of joy and nostalgia. I used happy and bright colors to emphasize this theme.
