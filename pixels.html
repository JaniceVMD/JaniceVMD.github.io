                With the nostalgia and hopeful theme in mind, I knew I wanted my pixel final project to have a fun, cheerful and summer vibe to it. Scrolling through the photos on my phone, I realized that I really miss summers at the beach with my younger siblings. Thus, I came up with this project. I ended up using an image on Unsplash for the little girl to represent my younger siblings. I added the frame around the central image to give it a message that viewers are peeking into my memories and the past. To imply movement, I added a beach ball into the piece and used a playful, handwriting type font.
