LIONEL MESSI!

On May 18, 2011, Lionel Messi made a name for himself when he scored this incredible goal against Getafe in a match in the Spanish first division. He dribbles through the entire opposing defense, including the goalkeeper, before cooly slotting the ball into the net. Amazing.



ANDRÃ‰S INIESTA!

Andres Iniesta is a home-grown talent from Spain. In 2010 he scored the goal that won Spain the World Cup. But for Barcelona fans, his most memorable moment came in the Champions League in May of 2009 when he scored a last-gasp goal that took the Catalans into the final. Incredible.



NEYMAR DASILVA!

Neymar daSilva was signed by FC Barcelona in the 2013-14 season from Brazilain club Santos.One of his first matches with the club was against arch-rivals Real Madrid. Of course, he scored the winning goal as his team went on to crush the opposition from the dark side! Awesome.
